However, at {siteConfig.name}, we strive to offer competitive and transparent pricing for our professional bond cleaning services.\n\n### Factors Influencing the Cost\n\n#### Property Size\n\nThe overall square footage of the rental property is a major determinant of the bond cleaning cost.

These extras can increase the overall cost.\n\n### Transparent Pricing Policy\n\nAt {siteConfig.name}, we believe in providing upfront, honest pricing with no hidden fees.

If you’ve seen an end of lease cleaning checklist, you’ll know there’s a lot to do to bring a property up to scratch at the end of a rental period. Here are some of the services your end of cleaning service might include:\n\n### General end of lease cleaning tasks\n\nAn end of lease clean will start with general surface cleaning of kitchens, bathrooms, and floors. Then your cleaner will concentrate on key areas around the home that require extra attention. With everything moved out of your home, your end of lease cleaner can get into the difficult spots to make sure your house is fully clean and ready for your real estate’s final inspection.\n\n### Wall and floor cleaning\n\nYour end of lease cleaner will clean marks from all walls, then dust and wipe your skirting boards and architraves.We’ll vacuum your carpets and mop hard floors mopped, paying special attention to stubborn stains. Bond cleaners are unable to repair damaged walls, so you may need to get a handyman service to assist.\n\n### Oven cleaning\n\nCleaning ovens can be a tough job. Whether it’s built-up grease, spilt food, or an oven door you can barely see-through, an experienced end of lease cleaner will have your oven looking good as new in no time. We’ll remove any oven rack and trays and soak them in the sink with hot, soapy water. Meanwhile, we’ll treat the inside of your oven with a cream cleanser or a special oven cleaning chemical treatment to break down grease and food remnants. Finally, we’ll wipe everything clean and dry, then put your oven back together.\n\n### Window and blind cleaning\n\nYour cleaner will take care of window cleaning, inside and out (if it’s easily accessible), as well as vacuuming and wiping the window tracks vacuumed. We’ll do basic dust and wipe down of blinds, but you’ll need a specialised blind cleaner if we need removing.\n\n### Clean fixtures and fittings\n\nPlenty of dust and bugs get caught in light fittings, so these will need to be thoroughly cleaned. Your end of lease cleaner will also clean your fans, air-conditioner, and range hood to remove any dust or grime that’s accumulated over time.\n\n### Additional cleaning services\n\nWhile end of lease cleaning focuses on a deep clean, you may still have several additional items to take care of as part of your rental obligations. From carpet cleaning and pest control through to outdoor cleaning and garden maintenance, it’s a good idea to hire some help so you can hand the keys back sooner.\n\n## What does end of lease cleaning include?\n\nOnce you’ve packed up and moved out all your personal belongings, it’s time to call in your end of lease cleaner.

## How much does bond cleaning coast in Canberra?

The cost of bond cleaning in the Canberra region can vary depending on several factors. However, we strive to offer competitive and transparent pricing for our professional bond cleaning services.

### Factors Influencing the Cost

#### Property Size

The overall square footage of the rental property is a major determinant of the bond cleaning cost. Larger homes or apartments generally require more time and effort to clean thoroughly, resulting in higher costs.

#### Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms

Properties with more bedrooms and bathrooms typically incur higher bond cleaning fees due to the increased cleaning requirements in these high-traffic areas.

#### Condition of the Property

If the rental property has been heavily soiled or neglected during the tenancy, it may require more intensive cleaning efforts, which can drive up the cost of the bond clean.

#### Additional Services

Some tenants may require additional services beyond the standard bond clean, such as carpet cleaning, window cleaning, or oven detailing. These extras can increase the overall cost.

### Transparent Pricing Policy

We believe in providing upfront, honest pricing with no hidden fees. To give you an idea, our bond cleaning services typically start at around $250 for a standard 2-bedroom apartment or unit. However, we recommend requesting a personalized quote to get an accurate estimate based on your specific property's size and condition.

Rest assured, our experienced bond cleaners work efficiently to deliver exceptional results while keeping our prices competitive and fair. We understand the importance of getting your full bond back, and we strive to make our services accessible and affordable for all tenants in the Canberra area.

## What does end of lease cleaning include?

Once youâ€™ve packed up and moved out all your personal belongings, itâ€™s time to call in your end of lease cleaner. If youâ€™ve seen an end of lease cleaning checklist, youâ€™ll know thereâ€™s a lot to do to bring a property up to scratch at the end of a rental period. Here are some of the services your end of cleaning service might include:

### General end of lease cleaning tasks

An end of lease clean will start with general surface cleaning of kitchens, bathrooms, and floors. Then your cleaner will concentrate on key areas around the home that require extra attention. With everything moved out of your home, your end of lease cleaner can get into the difficult spots to make sure your house is fully clean and ready for your real estateâ€™s final inspection.

### Wall and floor cleaning

Your end of lease cleaner will clean marks from all walls, then dust and wipe your skirting boards and architraves.Weâ€™ll vacuum your carpets and mop hard floors mopped, paying special attention to stubborn stains. Bond cleaners are unable to repair damaged walls, so you may need to get a handyman service to assist.

### Oven cleaning

Cleaning ovens can be a tough job. Whether itâ€™s built-up grease, spilt food, or an oven door you can barely see-through, an experienced end of lease cleaner will have your oven looking good as new in no time. Weâ€™ll remove any oven rack and trays and soak them in the sink with hot, soapy water. Meanwhile, weâ€™ll treat the inside of your oven with a cream cleanser or a special oven cleaning chemical treatment to break down grease and food remnants. Finally, weâ€™ll wipe everything clean and dry, then put your oven back together.

### Window and blind cleaning

Your cleaner will take care of window cleaning, inside and out (if itâ€™s easily accessible), as well as vacuuming and wiping the window tracks vacuumed. Weâ€™ll do basic dust and wipe down of blinds, but youâ€™ll need a specialised blind cleaner if we need removing.

### Clean fixtures and fittings

Plenty of dust and bugs get caught in light fittings, so these will need to be thoroughly cleaned. Your end of lease cleaner will also clean your fans, air-conditioner, and range hood to remove any dust or grime thatâ€™s accumulated over time.

### Additional cleaning services

While end of lease cleaning focuses on a deep clean, you may still have several additional items to take care of as part of your rental obligations. From carpet cleaning and pest control through to outdoor cleaning and garden maintenance, itâ€™s a good idea to hire some help so you can hand the keys back sooner.

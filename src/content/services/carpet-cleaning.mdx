## Importance of Carpet Cleaning

Before exploring the specifics of our carpet cleaning service, it's crucial to understand why regular carpet maintenance is essential for both residential and commercial properties.

### Enhances Indoor Air Quality

Carpets act as filters, trapping dust, dirt, allergens, and other airborne particles that can compromise indoor air quality. Regular cleaning removes these contaminants, promoting a healthier living and working environment for occupants.

### Prolongs Carpet Lifespan

Accumulation of dirt and debris can accelerate carpet wear and tear, leading to premature deterioration. Professional cleaning removes embedded dirt and stains, extending the lifespan of your carpets and preserving their appearance.

### Improves Aesthetic Appeal

Clean carpets contribute to the overall aesthetics of a space, enhancing its visual appeal and creating a positive impression on visitors and guests. Regular cleaning removes unsightly stains and odors, restoring the beauty of your carpets and revitalizing the ambiance of your space.

## Our Carpet Cleaning Process

Our carpet cleaning service is designed to provide a thorough and effective clean, using state-of-the-art equipment and eco-friendly solutions. Here's what the process typically entails:

1. **Pre-Inspection**: One of their technicians will conduct a thorough inspection of your carpets, identifying any areas of concern, such as heavily soiled or stained areas.
2. **Furniture Moving**: To ensure a comprehensive clean, our team will carefully move any furniture and other obstacles, allowing them to access every inch of your carpeted areas.
3. **Pre-Treatment**: Depending on the condition of your carpets, their technicians may apply a pre-treatment solution to break down stubborn stains and soils, making them easier to remove during the cleaning process.
4. **Hot Water Extraction**: Using state-of-the-art truck-mounted equipment, our team will perform a deep clean using hot water extraction, also known as steam cleaning. This method effectively removes deeply embedded dirt, allergens, and residue from your carpets.
5. **Spot Treatment**: Any remaining stubborn stains or spots will be treated with specialized solutions and techniques to ensure a thorough and complete clean.
6. **Post-Cleaning Inspection**: Once the cleaning is complete, a final inspection will be conducted to ensure that your carpets meet our high standards of cleanliness and your expectations.

## What does a carpet cleaning service include?

The most common professional carpet cleaning services involve either carpet steam cleaning, dry cleaning, or shampooing the carpets in your home (depending on their preferred techniques and equipment). But most carpet cleaners can do a lot more than just your carpets. The inclusions of cleaning services will vary, depending on what you need:

### General carpet cleaning

Most modern homes will have at least three carpeted bedrooms that need a deep clean once a year. Before your professional cleaner arrives, try to expose as much carpet fibres as possible by moving small furniture pieces to other areas of your home (don’t worry about larger furniture, as the carpet underneath won’t be super dirty). Vacuum the floor to remove surface dirt unless your cleaner includes this in their cleaning services. Your cleaner will take a couple of hours to clean your floors, paying particular attention to any stains. Before you put back your furniture or any floor coverings, it’s ideal if you can wait a few hours to let the carpet dry. You can speed up the process by turning your fans on high and encouraging airflow.

### Carpet stain removal

Stains happen, but you don’t have to live with them forever. Simply find a carpet steam cleaning service near you that’s experienced in carpet stain removal from coffee and wine to crayons, pen marks, and pet messes. They’ll focus their efforts on removing stubborn stains with powerful equipment and cleaning solutions to loosen up the marks and get your carpet looking (and smelling) fresh again.

### Rug cleaning

Don’t forget to include your rugs when you book your carpet cleaning service. Professional rug cleaning will help get your rug looking like new so it can last for years to come. As with carpet cleaning, you can expect your cleaner to use their equipment and chemicals to deep-clean the carpet fibres and remove any stains. Then you’ll need to allow a few hours for your rugs to dry.

### Couch and upholstery cleaning

Get your fabric lounge chairs smelling like new again with professional couch cleaning and upholstery cleaning. Your cleaner will use special chemicals and equipment to dissolve stains and built-up grime, before rinsing it clean. It might take up to 24 hours for your lounge chairs to thoroughly dry.

### Mattress cleaning

Find a carpet cleaning service near you that offers mattress cleaning, and you can get all the soft furnishings in your home sorted. Refresh your mattress with a deep clean to reduce allergens like dust mites and germs. Your cleaner will inspect, vacuum, and pre-treat your mattress. Then they’ll extract the dirt, rinse your mattress, and deodorise it to help it stay fresh for longer.

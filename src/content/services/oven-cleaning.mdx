## Importance of Oven Cleaning

Before exploring the specifics of our oven cleaning service, it's essential to understand why regular oven maintenance is crucial for both the functionality and aesthetics of your kitchen.

- **Ensures Food Safety**: A clean oven is essential for maintaining food safety and preventing cross-contamination. Residue and buildup in the oven can harbor harmful bacteria and germs, compromising the safety of the food prepared within.

- **Improves Cooking Efficiency**: A clean oven operates more efficiently, distributing heat evenly and allowing for more consistent cooking results. Buildup of grease and grime can interfere with the oven's heating elements, leading to uneven cooking and longer cooking times.

- **Enhances Kitchen Aesthetics**: A clean oven contributes to the overall aesthetics of the kitchen, creating a welcoming and inviting space for cooking and entertaining. Removing baked-on grease and food residue restores the oven's appearance, making it a focal point rather than an eyesore.

## What does an oven cleaning service include?

While the result is the same (a clean oven or appliance), the exact process will depend on the type of appliance and oven you want to be cleaned. Here’s what you can expect from a standard professional oven cleaning service: 

**Step 1: Prep**

When booking your professional oven cleaning service, choose a time when you’ll be at home or available to let your cleaner in, and ensure they’ll have access to a sink and water supply. Allow 1-2 hours for the full task, but the time needed will depend on the size and condition of your oven.

**Step 2: Assessment**

Before getting started, your professional oven cleaner will cast an expert eye over your oven. Sometimes the cost of professional oven cleaning services can be more or less than the original quote, but if there’s a change in price, they’ll discuss it with you first. 

**Step 3: Set up**

Your oven cleaner will bring their own cleaning products and clothes, as well as protective sheets (to cover the surrounding floor and surfaces during particularly messy jobs). Next, they’ll switch off your oven off at the mains and take out all the racks and shelves. Depending on the service you’ve booked, they may also remove your oven door.   

**Step 4: Cleaning inside the oven**

Your oven cleaner will start by loosening and wiping away food debris, before applying their preferred product to the door and inside the oven, taking care to avoid the fan and heating element. During an oven detailing service, they’ll also remove the lining to make it easier to clean each lining panel. Then your cleaner can wipe away any grease that’s built up behind the lining. 

Most specialist oven cleaning products need 10-20 minutes to work. After that, they’ve wiped away with a non-abrasive, clean, damp cloth that’ll also remove any burnt-on grease. If there are any stubborn spots, your cleaner will repeat the process. 

**Step 5: Washing the shelves**

Meanwhile, your cleaner will wash the shelves. Some oven cleaning services bring their own dip trays and use professional oven cleaning solutions which work in minutes. But it’s also common to spray the racks with the same product used inside the oven, wrap each shelf in a sealed bag, and leave the solution to work before rinsing off. But if your oven trays aren’t too dirty, they may just need a firm scrub in hot, soapy water.

**Step 6: Dry off and clean up**

Once the product has been wiped away from your oven and shelves, your professional oven cleaner will dry everything off with soft cloths. Then they’ll put your oven back together, flick the mains power back on, and clear up any protective sheeting.
